# Embedded Engineering Summary
I provide contract services for embedded engineering.

## Contract Skills
* Firmware Engineering

## Expirience
* Validation Engineer, Silicon Labs
 * Wrote C firmware to validate digital peripherals on new MCUs. For example: DMA, IRQs, PWM, etc
 * Validated using both pre-silicon FPGA models and the MCUs.
* Intern, Silicon Labs
 * Armduino (see Projects section)

## Projects
* [Armduino](https://github.com/boltonja/armduino/): Silicon Labs based Arduino
 * Successfully created firmware for the SiM3U1xx ARM M3
 * Ported high level libraries to the chip
* [Espresso Controller](https://github.com/nickgeoca/espresso_controller/)
 * Replaced analog PID controller of Francis Francis X5 with Arduino PID
 * Significantly improved taste

## General Skills
* Peripherals: RS232, SPI, IRQ, DMA, Timers, PWM, DAC, IDAC, etc
* Languages: C, Python, Perl
* Architectures: ARM, PowerPC
